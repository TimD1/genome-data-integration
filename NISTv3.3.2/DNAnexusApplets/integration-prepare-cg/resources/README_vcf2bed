================================================================================
vcf2bed.py - A script to determine called (or no-called) regions from a VCF file
================================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

    ./vcf2bed.py vcf_input_file no_ref_regions_input_file bed_output_file [ options ]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Options:

    -include_partial_calls		(consider partial calls to be calls)
    -not_pass_calls_are_no-calls	(consider calls that are not "PASS" to be no-calls)
    -print_no-calls			(print no-call regions, instead of call regions)
    -use_FT_instead_of_FILTER		(use FT flag, rather than FILTER column*)

*The last option should be set for VCF-Beta format, but not for the new VCF format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts needed:

    vcf2bed.py
    vcf2bed_helper_module.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input files:

    vcf_input_file		(VCF file to learn called, or no-called,
				 regions from)

    no_ref_regions_input_file	(The set of no-ref regions in the genome:
				 Before printing a region to the output file,
				 we remove any part of that region that
				 overlaps with a no-ref region)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output file:

    bed_output_file		(BED output file to which the called,
				 or no-called, regions are printed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Notes:

	[1.] Any full ref call for which

		(A) the value of the FT flag is the empty string
			[if the option "-use_FT_instead_of_FILTER" is specified]

		(B) the value of the FILTER entry is "."
			[if the option "-use_FT_instead_of_FILTER" is not specified]

	is treated as having an FT/FILTER value of PASS.


	[2.] Any partial ref call (but not a mixed ref/variant call) for which

		(A) the value of the FT flag is the empty string
			[if the option "-use_FT_instead_of_FILTER" is specified]

		(B) the value of the FILTER entry is "NC-CORR" or "NOCALL"
			[if the option "-use_FT_instead_of_FILTER" is not specified]

	is treated as having an FT/FILTER value of PASS.


	[3.] Before printing a given call or no-call region, we first

	divide/trim that region according to any overlapping 'no-ref'

	regions that were listed in the user-specified 'no-ref' file.


	[4.] Any non-'no-ref' position that is not accounted for by

	any entry in the VCF file is treated as a full reference call with a

	filter value of PASS.


	[5.] For every entry in the VCF file, I check for a padding region

	by looking for the maximum-length prefix shared between the base

	sequence in the REF field and all distinct (comma-delimited) base

	sequences in the ALT field. 


	If this shared prefix has a length of exactly 1,

	then I remove it from the entry by incrementing

	the start position of the entry by 1, and then

	I do NOT consider that shared prefix to be a

	separate entry in and of itself.


	If this shared prefix has a length of greater than 1,

	then I take no action, thereby considering it

	as part of the original entry.

	(We looked at seven entries in the VCF file that had a

	 multi-base shared prefix, and we found that, for each of

	 these entries, it was **NOT** the case that the full set

	 of positions covered by that multi-base shared prefix

	 were listed in the VAR file as a full-ref call with

	 PASS quality/qualities.)


	[6.] It appears that when there is a mixed ref/variant

	call in the VCF file, then the value of the FT flag or

	FILTER field (depending on whether we are looking at an

	old format or new format VCF) will refer to the allele

	called as variant, rather than the allele called as ref.

	(We are not sure if this holds in all cases, only that it

	 holds for at least one entry in a new format VCF file

	 and at least one entry in an old format VCF file,

	 where both VCF entries were identified by searching for

	 entries called as 0/1 or 1/0-- depending on which VCF file

	 we were looking at-- with a low quality filter value.

	 To verify each case, we compared the entry in the VCF file

	 to the corresponding entry/entries in the VAR file.)


	[7.] Mixed ref/variant calls (0/1 or 1/0) are not considered

	to be partial calls.


	[8.] We do not print out any call regions for chromosomes

	for which there are no explicitly defined entries in the VCF file.
