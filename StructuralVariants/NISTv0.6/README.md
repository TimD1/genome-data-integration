** This is a work in progress **

This directory contains the scripts used to generate the GIAB v0.6 SV Benchmark Set. These script are provided for transparency, but we do not expect these will be straightforward for others to run.
Work is underway to develop a pipeline to enable GIAB to generate SV benchmark sets for multiple genomes.

These methods and results are described in the biorxiv manuscript https://doi.org/10.1101/664623
